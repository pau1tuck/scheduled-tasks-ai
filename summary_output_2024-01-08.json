    "dataset_summary": "This dataset provides a detailed statistical summary of website performance metrics over a span of 42 days, centered around the mid-January period of 2024. The average number of sessions per day is approximately 770, with users averaging nearly 596 and new users being around 207 per day. A significant amount of pageviews is recorded, averaging about 2874 daily, complemented by an average of 3.58 pages per session, suggesting reasonable engagement levels. The average session lasts around 128 seconds, with a bounce rate of approximately 28%. Notably, the conversion rate is relatively low at 2.78%, yet transactions average about 17 per day, indicating that while user acquisition may be moderate, those engaged result in financial transactions amounting to an average daily revenue of $815. Variability is considerable across these metrics, particularly with a wide standard deviation in transactions and revenue, suggesting fluctuating daily performance. Extremely high maximum values, such as 2138 sessions and a peak revenue of $3277, indicate occasional spikes, likely due to specific events or promotions that temporarily enhanced user engagement and sales figures.",
