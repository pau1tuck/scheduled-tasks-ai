    "dataset_summary": "The dataset provides a detailed view of website interactions over a period, highlighting user engagement and conversion metrics. On average, there were 729 sessions per day, with a significant variance as the minimum was 181 and the maximum 1940 sessions, showing possible peak days or events. Users averaged at 584.81 per day, indicating a solid user base, although the new user average was notably lower at 200.76, which could imply either high return rates or less attraction to new users. The average pageviews reached 2650.88, suggesting substantial user engagement per session, supported by the average pages per session metric at 3.54. The session duration averaged 143.54 seconds, which shows users spend a considerable amount of time engaged per session. The bounce rate at 24.62% is relatively low, indicating effective user retention on initial pages. With a conversion rate of 2.64%, there is moderate success in turning interactions into actions. Transactions averaged at 15.07 per day, contributing to an average daily revenue of 755.10, indicating satisfactory financial outcomes from the user activities, albeit with room for improvement in conversion efficiency.",
