    "comparison_summary": "Week 1 and Week 2 both cover a 7-day period, capturing web analytic data focused on user engagement and interaction with a website. In Week 2, there is a general increase in sessions, pageviews, transactions, and revenue compared to Week 1, along with a notable decrease in bounce rate and an improved conversion rate. These differences suggest heightened user engagement and effectiveness in converting visits into transactions during Week 2, despite slightly fewer average users and new users compared to Week 1.",
