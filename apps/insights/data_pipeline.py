Title: Data Pipeline for CSV Processing and LLM Integration
Description:
This script orchestrates the data pipeline for processing GA4 CSV data.
It validates, cleans, filters, and generates statistical overviews,
and optionally integrates with an LLM for dataset summaries.

Usage:
Run this file directly to execute the pipeline:
    python -m apps.insights.data_pipeline
